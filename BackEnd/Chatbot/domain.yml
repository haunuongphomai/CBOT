              go for “long int” and “long long int” for which the limits are very high. \n

              - We can’t store decimal values using int data type. \n

              "for loop: This kind of loop performs the execution of a sequence of various statements various times.
              It then abbreviates the available code that manages the variables of the loop.\n
              while loop: This type of loop is used for repeating any given statement or a group of various statements whenever the condition we have is true.
              Thus, it will perform the testing of the condition before the execution of the body of the loop.\n
              do…while loop: This loop is just like the while statement. The only exception is that the do-while statement performs the testing of
              the condition that is present at the very end of a loop body.\n
              nested loops: We can make use of a single loop or multiple loops inside any other loop, such as for, while, or even the do-while loop."

              "A function is a group of statements that are designed to perform a certain task.\n
              Most of the time functions are used to divide up our code into simpler parts that make the code easier to read and debug.\n
              Functions must be declared before usage.\n
              A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.\n
              Now that we understood the basic concepts of functions let's see the anatomy one by one.\n
